The MBTATracker application is an Enyo webOS-based app that runs on HP Touchpad.
The basic use-case for the application is as follows:

1. Launch the app
2. app requests the Palm Location Service for current GPS location
3. app zooms Microsoft Bing map to appropriate zoom level for current location
4. app reaches out to NextBus webservice and queries for lat/lon position of all moving buses
5. app receivces response from webservice and renders all buses as pushpins on the map
6. user has options to filter display by specific bus lines

Future work:

Make push-pins clickable:  When user clicks, info balloon is displayed that shows more information about that bus:  Bus #, Current Speed, Current Heading, etc...

Render all bus stops in different colors:  North Bound vs. South Bound, etc...

Use the NextBus Service to query for predicated arrival times.

The service is @ 

url: "http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=vehicleLocations&a=mbta&t=0",
This is an HTTP GET Request, which can also be pulled with curl:

curl <URL>


with the xml output:


<vehicle id="0889" routeTag="455" dirTag="455_1_var8" lat="42.466605" lon="-70.94196" secsSinceReport="113" predictable="true" heading="216" speedKmHr="0.0"/>
<vehicle id="1212" routeTag="28" dirTag="28_1_var2" lat="42.3342113" lon="-71.0899042" secsSinceReport="38" predictable="true" heading="54" speedKmHr="0.0"/>
